# Architecture — engine vs. game

LIGHTLAG is deliberately split so the **physics is a reusable engine** and any
particular **game is a thin layer on top**. If you want to build a different
game around the same hard-physics rules (a courier sim, a 4X, a survival
sandbox), you keep `@lightlag/engine` and replace the layers above it.

The split is now a **real package boundary**, not just a folder convention:

```
packages/engine/   →  @lightlag/engine   the physics engine (this repo's first product)
src/render|ui|app  →  the game           the strategy sim built on the engine
```

## The one rule

**Dependencies point inward, never outward.**

```
app/  ─┐
ui/   ─┼──►  @lightlag/engine     the engine imports NOTHING from app, ui, or render.
render/┘                      (no Three.js, no DOM, no game-specific assumptions)
```

The engine (`packages/engine/src/`) has zero `import` from the game. The renderer
and UI are strictly *read-only views* of the simulation; only `Simulation.step()`
mutates state.

This is no longer enforced by convention alone. The engine is its own workspace
package with its own **DOM-free** `tsconfig`, and CI runs `npm run typecheck:engine`
against it: because that config's `lib` is `ES2022` only (no `"DOM"`) and it sees
no game source, any accidental reach into the browser, the renderer, or the game
layer fails to compile. The boundary is now self-enforcing.

The game consumes the engine through its package name, never a relative path:

```ts
import { summarizeOrbit } from "@lightlag/engine/orbit";   // fine-grained subpath
import { orbit, sim, vec3 } from "@lightlag/engine";        // namespaced barrel
```

`@lightlag/engine/<module>` maps 1:1 to `packages/engine/src/<module>.ts` via the
package's wildcard `exports`. There is no build step — Vite, Vitest, and `tsc`
(bundler resolution) all consume the engine's TypeScript source directly through
the workspace symlink.

## The engine — `packages/engine/` (`@lightlag/engine`, pure, deterministic, SI)

Game-agnostic. No framework, no renderer, no wall-clock, no `Math.random()` in
the hot path. Everything is double-precision SI and a pure function of state + time.
Module paths below are relative to `packages/engine/src/` (and imported as
`@lightlag/engine/<module>`). The package barrel `index.ts` re-exports every module
under a namespace for the `import { orbit, sim } from "@lightlag/engine"` form.

### Math primitives

| Module | Provides |
|---|---|
| `math/vec3.ts` | f64 vector ops (plain `{x,y,z}`, serializable). |
| `math/kepler.ts` | Kepler solvers (elliptic + hyperbolic), coe↔rv, propagation, orbit sampling. |
| `math/integrators.ts` | RK4 integrator for powered flight. |
| `math/relativity.ts` | Special-relativistic coordinate acceleration from a proper-frame force (Rindler decomposition along/across velocity, clamped below `c`) — the relativistic powered-flight derivative. |

### Core simulation

| Module | Provides |
|---|---|
| `constants.ts` | Physical constants + real Solar-System body data (JPL elements, μ=GM, radii, atmospheres). |
| `ephemeris.ts` | Analytic body state (position, velocity) at any `t`. |
| `orbit.ts` | vis-viva, apsides, periods, maneuver frame, SOI radius, Oberth burn, J2 secular precession rates, sun-synchronous inclination. |
| `propulsion.ts` | Rocket equation, staging, Δv budget, electric power law (`F = min(F_rated, 2ηP/vₑ)`), variable-Isp constant-power throttle (`variableIspBurn`: thrust↔Isp↔time trade at `F·vₑ = 2ηP`); per-stage tank capacity (`stageCapacity`/`stageHeadroom`, the refuelling ceiling). |
| `ships.ts` | Ship mass/state/orbit helpers; impulsive Δv (with affordability check); thermal state readout. `coastElements` advances a coasting conic by Kepler + J2 secular precession + optional closed-form secular atmospheric drag (`Ship.drag`: constant ṅ → ½·ṅ·dt² along-track + SMA decay), every rate constant so it stays exact at any time-warp. |
| `refuel.ts` | Rendezvous-gated orbital propellant transfer + in-orbit assembly: `dockState`/`isDockable` (shared-primary, co-located gate), `transferProp` (mass-conserving, capacity-capped), `mergeStacks` (dock-merge two craft into one). |
| `surface.ts` | Landing/takeoff Δv budgets: calibrated gravity-turn ascent through real exponential atmospheres, aerobraking fraction on descent. |
| `forces.ts` | Read-only force/momentum breakdown for the overlay: dominant gravitational pull, secondary tidal perturbation, and primary-relative velocity for a body or ship (`bodyForceBreakdown`, `shipForceBreakdown`). |
| `trajectory.ts` | Live ship forecast path sampled from osculating elements — a continuous, snap-free bound ellipse or unbound arc with a trailing past arc (`shipForecastPath`). |
| `route.ts` | Heliocentric Lambert transfer geometry for visualization: single- or multi-leg paths with optional gravity-assist bends and context rings (`planRoute`). |
| `thermal.ts` | Stefan-Boltzmann heat budget, solar flux (1/r²), detection range — the "no stealth in space" pillar. |
| `stars.ts` | Nearest ~24 star systems in ecliptic-J2000 frame (interstellar destinations). |
| `comms.ts` | Light-time, signal propagation at `c`, retarded (delayed) state of a moving target. |
| `serialize.ts` | Canonical, deterministic world serialization (sorted Maps, 12-sig-fig quantization) + `hashWorld` (the golden-state CI oracle). Foundation for Phase-8 save/load. |
| `scenario.ts` | Deterministic **snapshots & scenarios**: a lossless (full-f64) `SimSnapshot` of world + pending events + warp; `snapshot`/`restore`/`restoreInto` (bit-exact resume — the save/load + replay-scrub foundation); a serializable `Scenario` (seed + objectives) and `evaluateObjective`. The event queue is snapshotted as data, not re-derived. |
| `time.ts` | Clock, time-warp levels, deterministic event queue (with `snapshot`/`load`), calendar formatting. |
| `world.ts` | `WorldState` — plain serializable data (ships, stations, maneuvers, messages). |
| `sim.ts` | The deterministic step kernel: time advance, RK4 sub-stepping, event dispatch, **light-lag command delivery** (commands propagate at `c`, resolved against the ship's live state at delivery). |

### Maneuver solvers — `maneuver/`

|---|---|
| `maneuver/lambert.ts` | Lambert problem solver, single + multi-revolution. |

| `maneuver/flyby.ts` | Patched-conic gravity-flyby geometry (vₓ in/out rotation, turn angle, periapsis) + B-plane aim (`bPlaneAim`: free-bend hyperbola e/rp, impact parameter, B-vector/plane-normal). |
| `maneuver/assist.ts` | Gravity-assist solver: a two-leg single-flyby plan (`assistTransfer`) with grid search for the cheapest window, and an N-body multi-flyby chain (`chainAssist`, e.g. V-E-E-G-A) over a fixed schedule. |
| `maneuver/moon.ts` | Parent-centric Lambert transfer-window search from a parking orbit to a moon (J2-aware arrival aiming) — the LEO→Moon / planet-orbit→moon leg (`searchMoonWindow`). |
| `maneuver/moonTour.ts` | Parent-centric gravity-assist moon-flyby chains: planet orbit → free/paid moon flybys → capture (`searchMoonTour`, `moonTour`). |
| `maneuver/suggest.ts` | Auto-route suggester: ranks a direct transfer, single-flyby assists, and VEEGA-style two-flyby chains by the chosen criterion (`suggestRoutes`, `bestAssist`, `bestChain`). |
| `maneuver/criteria.ts` | Trajectory scoring layer — least-Δv / shortest-flight / balanced criterion with a strict total-order comparator (`score`, `better`, `Criterion`). |
| `maneuver/lowThrust.ts` | Edelbaum analytic spiral: exact Δv/time/propellant for a power-limited electric transfer between near-circular orbits (and coplanar inclination change), plus capture/escape spirals about a single body's well (the r→∞ limit, Δv = local circular speed). |
| `maneuver/entry.ts` | Ballistic atmospheric-entry trajectory (RK4 through the exponential atmosphere): peak deceleration, Sutton-Graves convective stagnation heat flux, radiative-equilibrium wall temperature, integrated heat load, and land/capture/skip-out outcome; plus single-pass aerocapture (bisection on the entry corridor) with the Δv saved vs a propulsive capture burn. |
| `maneuver/interstellar.ts` | Relativistic brachistochrone (flip-and-burn): rapidity rocket equation, coordinate/proper time, peak Lorentz factor, mass ratio, light-lag. |

### Engine contract
- **State is plain data.** `WorldState` is JSON-serializable (numbers, strings,
  `{x,y,z}`, Maps of those). No class instances with hidden state in the world.
- **One mutator.** `Simulation.step(dtSim)` is the only thing that advances state;
  it is deterministic in its argument (events fire at exact times; equal-time
  events break ties by insertion order).
- **Time is explicit.** Everything is a function of `t` (seconds since J2000).
- **Light-lag is native.** `sim.sendCommand(targetId, command)` emits a signal
  that propagates at `c` and is delivered when it reaches the (moving) ship.
  The command resolves against the ship's actual live state at delivery — the
  light-lag bargain, not a bug. A NACK propagates back at `c` if the ship cannot
  execute. Both directions are `MessageInFlight` entries in `WorldState`.

## The game / presentation — `src/render/`, `src/ui/`, `src/app/`

These live at the repo root under `src/` and depend on `@lightlag/engine`. This is
the current game (the strategy sim). A second purpose would be a sibling — a new
`apps/<name>/` (or its own `src/`) consuming the same engine. The modules here are
*views and intent*, never physics.

`src/sandbox/` is the first additional purpose growing in place (per the
multi-product plan): an orbital playground that adds **live-satellite ingestion**
(TLE→SGP4→read-only ships, `satellites.ts`), **mission replay/scrub** over the
deterministic engine (`replay.ts`, on `scenario.ts`), and **informative light-lag**
(`Simulation.commandPolicy`). It reuses the existing render/UI; its panel
(`ui/sandboxPanel.ts`) is purely additive. Shared packages (`viz`, `ui-kit`, …) get
extracted only when a *second* consuming app needs them.

A TLE is exact only near its epoch. Ingestion seeds the satellite's osculating
elements via SGP4 at spawn, then the engine coasts it — Kepler + J2 secular + a
**rung-1 secular drag** (the TLE's measured ṅ carried onto `Ship.drag`), which
reproduces the dominant multi-day along-track drift in closed form. It does **not**
reproduce SGP4's full drag/resonance behaviour (the decay runaway as perigee drops,
space-weather swings), so a residual drift remains over days — surfaced, not hidden.
See ROADMAP "rung-2 satellite drag" for the planned upgrade (altitude/B*/F10.7-driven
King-Hele decay).

## Building another game on the engine

Add `@lightlag/engine` as a dependency and provide your own render/UI layer and
your own `commands` + event semantics. The engine gives you correct orbits,
transfers, propulsion, SOI patched conics, thermal/detection, and light-lag for
free — none of it assumes a particular game.

```ts
import { Simulation } from "@lightlag/engine/sim";
import { createWorld } from "@lightlag/engine/world";
import { searchMoonWindow } from "@lightlag/engine/maneuver/moon";
// …your own commands, your own views, your own goals.
```

A new purpose lives beside the current game (e.g. `apps/courier/`), depends on the
same engine package, and is free to diverge completely above the physics. The
engine's golden-state determinism guard and full physics test suite protect every
consumer at once.

## Workspace layout

```
packages/
  engine/                @lightlag/engine — the physics engine (pure, SI, deterministic)
    package.json         name + wildcard exports ("./*" → "./src/*.ts"); no build step
    tsconfig.json        DOM-FREE config — the boundary gate (npm run typecheck:engine)
    src/                 the former src/core/, unchanged; index.ts is the namespaced barrel
src/                     the game (the strategy sim) — depends on @lightlag/engine
  render/ ui/ app/       Three.js views, DOM panels, wiring + command semantics
  integration/           app↔engine integration tests (see below)
```

npm workspaces wire it: the root is the game **and** the workspace root; `npm install`
symlinks `node_modules/@lightlag/engine` → `packages/engine`. One `tsc --noEmit` and one
`vitest` run cover both layers; `npm run typecheck:engine` additionally checks the engine
in DOM-free isolation as the enforced boundary.

### Why the integration tests moved

The engine's own test suite is pure — it imports only `@lightlag/engine`. Four suites,
however, drive the kernel **through the game's command layer** (`spawnShip`, `planTransfer`,
…), so they couple the engine to the app by definition. Those (`sim.test.ts`,
`integration.test.ts`, `j2.test.ts`, and their shared `test-helpers.ts`) now live in
`src/integration/` on the game side. Keeping them there is what lets the engine package
stand alone: `packages/engine/` has **zero** dependency on the game, in product code and
in tests alike.

## The one remaining tease-apart

`sim.ts` still contains *game-specific* event handlers (interplanetary transfer departure,
SOI capture, flyby pass, spiral arrival, and light-lag command delivery) alongside the
generic step/event kernel. They are pure and engine-safe today, but they bake in *this*
game's notion of what events mean. For maximum reuse across very different purposes, these
should become **handlers the consumer registers**, leaving `sim.ts` as just the generic
time-advance + event-queue machinery. This is the natural next refactor when a second
purpose needs different event semantics — `sim.ts` is the marker for it.
